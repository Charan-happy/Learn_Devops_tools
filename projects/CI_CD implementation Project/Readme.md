# Purpose and Objectives

The primary purpose of this project is to automate the softwware delivery lifecycle from code compilation to deployment threreby accelerating time-to-market, enhancing product quality, and reducing manual errors. The key objectives include

- Establishing seamless CI/CD pipeling using jenkins to automate various stages of the software delivery process.
- Integrating essential devops tools such as Maven, Sonarqube, trivy, Nexus Repository. docker, kubernetes, prometheus and grafana to ensure comprehensive automation and monitoring.
- Improving code quality through static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.
- Ensuring reliable and consistent deployments on kubernetes cluster with proper loadbalancing
- facilitating timely notification and alerts via email integration for efficient communication and incident management
- Implementing robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track system health and performance
