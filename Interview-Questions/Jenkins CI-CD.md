<details><summary>How do you reduce build time in CI/CD? </summary>Optimize build processes by using caching mechanisms, parallelizing build steps, using lightweight base images for Docker, and employing incremental builds. Tools like Jenkins pipelines and GitLab CI can help streamline these optimizations</details>
