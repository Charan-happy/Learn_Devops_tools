## 1. Introduction

- Ansible is an open-source software, automation engine, and automation language mainly used in software configuration management, infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. The ansible automation engine executes the playbooks.

The main qualities of ansible are :

**why do we need Ansible ?**

- Being a software developer or system administrator, we aware how challenging is to keep the application deployment and server's management efficient and reliable.

In simple terms, everything is more complex, bigger and faster.

This is why configuration management tools such as Ansible, chef, puppet and saltstack came to thrive as solutions for these internet age problems.

**What can Ansible be used for ?**
- Ansible has a wide range of usages. like

1. Infrastructure provisioning : Infrastructure provisioning is the process of setting up the IT infrastructures, which refers to the components, hardware and software needed to operate an application service or system. Bear in mind that provisioning is not the same as configuration. But both are steps in the deployment process

2. Configuration Management : configuration management is the process of maintaining infrastructure and software in a desired and consistent state. It's way to make sure that a system performs as expected as changes made over time.

- The great benefit of automating and having the configuration management processes in place is that it makes the deployments faster, removes the possibility of the human errors and manages the system in a predictable and stable state.
